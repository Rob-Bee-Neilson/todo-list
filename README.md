# todo-list
A typical todo list from scratch, full-stack with React, Redux, Thunk


## Build process
This is a step-by-step walkthrough of my thought process in building this web-app.

1 Starting with creating loading dev dependencies
  - server: 
    - routes
    - db
  - client:
    - actions
    - reducers
    - components
    - containers
    - index.js
  - test
  - `yarn add` dependencies and devDependencies
  - config webpack
  - `.gitignore` node_modules and other files
  
2 Add knex migration tables with dummy seed data

3 Basic database function and back end routes done for `getAllTodos`
